It's an HR Analytics dashboard

The analytical dashboard allows users to filter and segment data based on various criteria such as department, job level, tenure, and performance. This functionality allows for the extraction of valuable insights and empowers users to make data-driven decisions that support the growth and development of the organization.

We are using Tableau, a data visualization tool.
Tableau, a widely adopted data visualization tool, is leveraged to create this HR analytics dashboard. By utilizing Tableau, the organization can benefit from:

2. Identification of Improvement Opportunities: dashboard highlights areas where improvement efforts can be focused
3. Strategic Planning: The insights gained from the dashboard aid in the development of strategic plans, allowing organizations to align their human resources initiatives with broader organizational goals.
